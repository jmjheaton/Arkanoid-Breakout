# Arkanoid-Breakout
Great game based on the old Atari game called Breakout, with clock

I asked GPT to build an arduino game based on Arkanoid or Breakout for the Trinity PCB by @witnessmenow Brian Lough
After making the game, I asked GPT to add the clock
The clock needs wifi and you should change the network address and password in the arduino sketch

GOod luck and ask if you need any help
